city of Toronto to the point of collapse in 2003.  In fact, every day there is
a significant probability that a patient needing a critical-care bed in the
United States will not be able to find it.  Demographic trends are only going
to make this situation worse, as are the risks of terrorist attacks or flu
pandemics.  Unfortunately, medical practice and knowledge is still balkanized,
limiting the development and acceptance of best practices.  Keynote speaker
Timothy G. Buchman and respondents describe the challenges we face and what is
being done to overcome them.</p><h3>Keynote Speaker</h3>  <p class="bio"><img src="images/speakers_buchman.jpg" alt="Timothy G. Buchman" />Timothy G. Buchman is the Harry Edison Professor of Surgery, professor of

number of ever more sophisticated devices in order to tackle ever more complex
problems.  This approach has been followed in areas as diverse as aviation,
scientific computing, and detection of dangerous substances.  Because of this
trend, the opposite approach &mdash; using a large number of &ldquo;dumb&rdquo;
devices &mdash; has mostly been ignored.  Remarkably, this approach has been
used in biological contexts, from the immune system to ant colonies, with
extraordinary success.  Keynote speaker Richard M. Murray and respondents
describe the opportunities created by using large number of simple devices and
the novel challenges posed by their autonomy and self-coordination.</p><h3>Keynote Speaker</h3>  <p class="bio"><img src="images/speakers_murray.jpg" alt="Richard M. Murray" />Richard M. Murray received a BS degree in electrical engineering from the
California Institute of Technology in 1985 and MS and PhD degrees in electrical
engineering and computer sciences from the University of California, Berkeley,
in 1988 and 1991, respectively.  He is professor of control and dynamical
systems at Caltech.  Murray&rsquo;s research is in the application of feedback
and control to mechanical, information, and biological systems.  His current
projects include integration of control, communications, and computer science
in multi-agent systems; information dynamics in networked feedback systems;
analysis of insect flight-control systems; and synthetic biology using
genetically encoded finite-state machines.</p>  <p class="bio">Murray recently served on a National Research Council committee on network
science whose goal was to describe the current state of the art in network
science and make recommendations that can be used to guide decisions about
future directions in this area within the government.  He is developing a new
course at Caltech that is aimed at teaching the principles and tools of control
&mdash; with particular emphasis on applications in biology and computer
science &mdash; to a broader audience of scientists and engineers.</p><h3>Respondents</h3><p class="bio"><img src="images/speakers_mitchell.jpg" alt="Melanie Mitchell">Melanie Mitchell received a a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of

active senasing behaviors, and on the development of bio-inspired computational
models and hardware to test candidate neurobiological algorithms. Her lab is
particularly interested in how sensory feedback is used in real time to guide
motor activity, and how movement enables sensory acquisition and perception.
The main scientific interests of the lab are:<ul><li><p class="bio">How animal biomechanics enables efficient movement and active sensing.</p></li><li><p class="bio">How animals represent 3-dimensional spatial information using spatiotemporal
variations in activity across 2-dimensional receptor sheets.</p></li><li><p class="bio">How the construction of hardware and computer models of animal movement and
sensing can provide insights into the underlying organization of the nervous
system.</p></li></ul><p class="bio">Current research in the laboratory concentrates specifically on the sensory
modulation of behaviors involving rhythmic movement, because rhythmic movement,
and perturbations to it, is relatively easy to observe, measure, and quantify.
The lab works with two model systems that use sensory feedback to modulate
fundamentally periodic activity: rat whisking behavior, and bipedal locomotion.
By studying how sensory feedback affects periodic motion, she hopes to gain
insight into the continuous, recursive interplay between sensory and motor
signals during active behaviors.</p>  <h2 id="ostendorf">Speech and Music Systems:  Dynamics, Variation, and Emerging Technology</h2>  <h3>Friday, April 21, 9-11:30 a.m.</h3>  <p>Speech and music are temporally structured by their rhythmic patterns. 
Rhythmic patterns distinguish one language from another, one dialect from
another, and one musical style from another.  Varied in themselves, temporal
structures also induce immense variation in other aspects of the sound stream. 
Mastery of these structures, with all their manifestations, is a hallmark of
the virtuoso musician or the expressive speaker.  They pose a serious challenge
to the language learner, whether this learner is a person or a computer.</p>  <h3>Keynote Speaker</h3><p>Keynote speaker Mari Ostendorf and respondents from the fields of engineering,
brain science, and sociolinguistics discuss the temporal structures of speech
and music from different perspectives.  How do patterns arise as markers of
social identity?  What kind of dynamical system is responsible for their
production and perception in humans?  How can machine learning techniques
advance speech technology towards dialogue systems with rich, human-like,
behavior?</p>  <p class="bio"><img src="images/speakers_ostendorf.jpg" alt="Mari Ostendorf" />Mari Ostendorf received a PhD in electrical engineering from Stanford
